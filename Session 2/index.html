    <p>
      I live in Scotland. I am a career changer from the Education Sector. I
      discovered coding In January this year, when I completed a week's online
      code session with CodeClan Scotland. CodeClan spoke to students about the
      role of a 'Full Stack Developer'. I was instantly hooked! My goal is to
      gain employment as an Apprentice/Junior Front End Developer.
